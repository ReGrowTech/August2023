Type casting can be achived in two ways 
	1.	Implicit type casting- A smaller data type auto matically gets converted into a larger data type.It is also called widening 
	2.	Explicit type casting is conversion of lagrer data type to a smaller data type.we need to externally provide the data type of the smaller data type to the larger data type 

Eg-: { 
     int i1= 49;
        Char ch = (char)i1 
        System.out.println(ch);
}
